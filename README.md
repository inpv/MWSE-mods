# MWSE-mods
A collection of MWSE-Lua mods for TES3:Morrowind.

<p><b>Green Hideout</b></p>
<p>Enables clean tap water in the Green Hideout player home (interop to use with Ashfall).</p>

<p><b>Sepulchral Curses</b></p>
<p>Makes robbing tombs and barrows harder by adding a chance of summoning a random angry undead/elemental daedra when opening burial containers.</p>

<p><b>Soulful Dagoth Ur</b></p>
<p>Gives Dagoth Ur a soul of the same capacity as Vivec, so now you can soultrap him as well.</p>

<p><b>Staff Skill</b></p>
<p>Whenever a staff weapon is equipped, a dedicated Endurance-based Staff skill is used. Includes all staves from the vanilla game, expansions and Tamriel Rebuilt by default.</p>

<p><b>Vanish From Sight</b></p>
<p>As long as the player is invisible, all hostiles located in the current cell stop combat. Includes configurable fight values for hostiles in MCM. A must-have for any illusionist.</p>
